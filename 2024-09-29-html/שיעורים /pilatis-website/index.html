<h1><p style="text-align: center;">DO IT FOR YOUR SOUL</b></h1>

<hr>

<h3><p style="text-align: center;">is a type of mind-body exercise developed in the early 20th century by German physical trainer Joseph Pilates, after whom it was named.</p></h3>
<h4>Pilates uses a combination of around 50 repetitive exercises to spur muscle exertion. Each exercise flows from the "five essentials": breath, cervical alignment, rib and scapular stabilization, pelvic mobility, and utilization of the transversus abdominis.</h4>

    <p>Pilates was developed by Joseph Pilates from Mönchengladbach, Germany</p>
    <br>Pilates accompanied his method with a variety of equipment, which he called "apparatus". Each apparatus was designed to help accelerate the process of stretching, strengthening, body alignment and increased core strength started by mat work. The best-known and most popular apparatus today, the Reformer, was originally called the Universal Reformer, aptly named for "universally reforming the body". Eventually Pilates designed other apparatus, including the Cadillac, Wunda Chair, High "Electric" Chair, Spine Corrector, Ladder Barrel and Pedi-Pole.
